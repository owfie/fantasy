This is a custom fantasy app for a local frisbee league. Players have starting values, and players score points based on the number of goals, assists, D's, drops (negative), and turnovers (negative). Users can construct teams within a salary cap and choose a captain each week to score double points. Users can make up to 2 trades per week. There is a formula with a rolling average to calculate player value appreciation or depreciation based on points scored. There may also be a bracket playoff for fantasy teams towards the end of the league.
