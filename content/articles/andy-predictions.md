*TLDR: Actual predictions at the bottom.*

It has been a while since my last Super League ‘predictions’. I have hopefully left it late enough that Ted can’t pull a hack move again and just copy mine with tracked changes. Anyway, I know at least 3 of you who appreciate my ‘Trump weave’ style stream of consciousness enough for me to put my random thoughts, complaints and subtle jabs into a (hopefully) satisfactory level of pre-Super League propaganda. The greatest time of year is upon us! Let’s get into Super League 2026!

Starting with the best from the wild west! **West Beach Titans.**

Harry is on point with his basketball references. Similar to the USA Olympic team in Paris, this is as close to an all-star team, from 5-15 years ago, as the draft would allow. Without looking up actual stats, West Beach Titans have Greg Schrader and Warren-White, with a combined number of first round selections going into the 30s (surely) Add two-time winning captain Andy Badics, and the man once touted by yours truly as the closest thing we have to the next Joel Pillar: Tim Davis. On top of all that, the most dominant player from the most recent league and the actual winner of the Joel Pillar award, Dan Robots 🤖, as well as the actual Joel Pillar-Rogers himself! This team seems outrageously stacked… until you look at all the other teams.

So on that, let's look at how this team might handle this league. Pillar-Rogers is known amongst the OG to have dragged many underwhelming, underdog teams, kicking and screaming (sometimes literally) to victory. He is an unbelievably competitive and knowledgeable contributor, and after a year of Worlds training, hopefully he has stayed healthy and athletic enough to provide some fun this league. In saying that, he is a difficult pick for a captain and possibly the biggest gamble in the league. Once Alfie chose Joel he sealed his fate and from that point on chose players to fit this game plan.

Luis Ruiz is a solid rookie marquee and can be a very handy zippy reset handler for Joel and the other slow movers on the pitch. Schrader always looks fit, but is he skinny-fat or is it real fitness? Either way, on offence hopefully the throwing pressure is off so he can holster the hammer and get upfield to dominate once again! 

Marty made a great point that, on offence, which other team can simultaneously guard Roberts, Schrader, M. Tonkin, T. Davis and Warren-White for height, not to mention Edgeworth and Hager for speed, especially while decent throws can come from anywhere.

The bigger question on everyone’s lips is defence. Super League teams can usually hide one, or maybe two slower defenders. What happens when you have Marty, Tim, Sid, Joel, Andy and even Jony on the line? I, for one, believe these old players are competitively driven enough to easily fight it out for one game in a week. That, and a lot of switchy, junky, zone-style defence… naturally. I’m excited to see how this plays out.


Next up, the bad guys if Super League were a film. **East Adelaide Force.**

Foley the ageless man, is an engine room in a team full of other engines. Tran, Eppelstun, Patil, Lyttle and the great man himself, Eichner. This team's driving safe offence with persistent movement and strong defensive pressure will be hard to slow. Perhaps some strong wind will provide an opening for other, more skilled throwing and taller teams. 

Unfortunately for this team, insider gossip reveals that their courageous captain, Lachie Eichner, will likely be missing a big chunk of games. Without Lachie, you have to admit that this team looks significantly easier to manage, going from migraine to manageable headache. 

Sam Caon is still a great pick-up as a specialist Super League talisman, especially with all the engines around him. He has solid around break throws and constantly threatens the deep look, perfect for this team’s offensive structure. Sol Gunson, considered a poor choice this high based on last year’s Super League, has shown that a year of development in the life of an 18-year-old is a very long time. I predict marked improvement, even across the seven weeks of Super League. He could be topping the goal scorer stats after the first couple of rounds. 

There is some potential to get some turnovers out of Wachtel, but with the throwing ability of the players around him, it's likely he won't be so tempted into taking the glory shots. Ted, at his best, is an unreal pick-up in the fourth round, and I think he has the fire in the belly to show people that this league.   


**Southside Riptide**

I think the strength of this team is in their lack of weak links. Ryan Froud is possibly the weakest of the four rookie marquees, but that is more of a reflection on the strength of the field this year. Ryan is solid - which is kind of how I feel about almost every player in this team, from captain to second reserve. Solid, but not necessarily ‘stand-out’. I do think that the late round pick-ups of Wong and Sim could prove to be the most valuable. These guys, while still a little green, are very fit, fast and surprisingly skillful to the uninitiated. With strong guidance from the rest of the team, they are great listeners and really strengthen this team from the bottom up. 

It is very difficult to work out where everyone will fit into this team. Matthew Gordon will obviously be their primary target, but will also draw the toughest match-up and specific defensive strategies. Beyond Matty, any other deep option seems opportunistic rather than specifically designed. Harry Buckland is not tall, but showed an incredible ability to step up a level at Div 1 nationals last year. He went from being a fringe selection, to a fringe selection for the power line. Perhaps he’d be their consistent supplementary deep option. 

Word on the street is that both Sean Davis and Sam Tonkin prefer to play upfield. I personally think that Saldarriaga is most potent as a handler, but can he be the main man in that role? Almost every other player is a solid utility, so what will this team do? I am genuinely curious about Brill’s tactical decisions here. He has been a surprisingly successful captain over the years, so I am genuinely intrigued to watch his team’s season unfold. My guess is that Sean and Sam will be frustrated into handling anyway and this team will be a tough nut to crack, with players roaming all over the field.

Finally, the **Northern Flyers.**

This is a scary looking team on paper. Oscar Turnbull is the biggest frother I’ve seen since a young Pillar-Rogers. I fucking love your work Oscar! 

Rahmadhan has traditionally struggled to carry teams on his back, but when surrounded by good players he then, frustratingly, plays his best. Unfortunately for the rest of us, Ferdy is surrounded by good players here. 

Jairo Garcia may not be able to play his strongest role - handler - but if it were me, I would place him there anyway and put any of Turnbull, Rahmadhan or Donaldson upfield to give him consistently strong cutting options to aim at. 

A lot has been said about Keith Chau. Apparently he is fit and firing. I am excited to see this, but also scared - what a pain he could be when he’s the 5th guy you have to call a match-up for. Alec Deslandes is also another engine room cutter and handy receiver. Not sure how he is going for fitness, but he has always been one for opposition teams to think about, even going into his 40s. Galbraith Cheng is similar to Jairo. I would be tempted to try these guys in the back-field, in order to strengthen the upfield options. I know Oscar won’t do this, but it’d be fun to consider. 

Regardless, Donaldson, on this team, perhaps on any team, should be upfield more. Another tough pick for captains at that height in the draft. You hope to get the best out of him, and cannot leave him for the other captains, but there is always a risk he will mess around and not grit his teeth for the hard-fought win. Perhaps he won’t need to anyway, with the strength of the rest of his team.


**Other random thoughts:**

I think this is the deepest draft I've seen in a long time, probably ever. While it may not have the highest highs, there were definitely some very tough exclusions. Srinivasan, Christopherson, Bamford Clark and Sim coming in as 11th men is ridiculous. 3 out of 4 were former nationals Div 1, with Nathan narrowly missing out this season. Appleby, Aguirre and Truong have been former standouts as midrange or late picks in the draft in previous years, and are now sadly only on the reserve list. Up-and-comers such as Thein (watch out), Linke and Kraghe are set to make a big impact if they get the chance. Hopefully they do.

**Lead Balloons:**

**Joel Pillar-Rogers** - if he is injured or non-committal again, for which there is a much greater than zero chance. Unfortunately for us, his life doesn’t revolve around frisbee anymore. I hope I'm wrong and he finds enough pain relief from modern medicine, and enough joy from playing with old mates.

**Sam Caon** - if this is the year he’s finally too slow.

**Camilo Lopez** - I have to pick someone. Maybe he will throw it away too much in the excitement of Super League.

**Jack Donaldson** - He could go either way, but with 50/50 odds he will fuck around and waste his talents, I have to name and shame! 

**Moneyball picks:**

**Tim Davis** - he is competitive, smart, tall and hopefully fit enough to make a real impact from that low in the draft. 

**Justin Tan** - another one of the new recruits to outbreak, from what I’ve seen I think with a bit of polish, he could play well above what his 10th man selection suggests.

**Jerrell Alexander** - I haven't seen him in years and I’ve already mentioned Charles and Nathan, but my guess is that Jono called him up to check his status before the draft. He will be fit and will bat well above the average for a 27th pick.

**Harley Smith** - Young farmers are always fit, and Harley will sneak into the endzone for many goals this season.


**Final standings:**

Who knows who will be injured and who will rock up, but I have to throw it out there…

1. Flyers (4W2L) 
2. Titans (3W3L)
3. Riptide (3W3L)
4. Force (2W4L) 

Flyers in the GF over Titans. Force for third over Riptide to finish the season.
