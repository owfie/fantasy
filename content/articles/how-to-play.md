-----------------------------------

Super League Fantasy is simple: you pick a squad of real players, they play games, you score points. The better they play, the higher you climb on the leaderboard.

You’re competing against other managers across the league. Budget, form, and availability all matter — this isn’t just picking the flashiest names.

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up** – create an account.
2. **Create your team** – one squad per manager.
3. **Pick your 10 players** – stay under the cap.

That’s it. No complicated drafts, no timers, just your team, your choices.

## Building Your Team

### Team Structure

Your squad needs **10 players**:

* **4 Handlers** (3 starters, 1 bench)
* **3 Cutters** (2 starters, 1 bench)
* **3 Receivers** (2 starters, 1 bench)

**Starting lineup**: 7 players who score points.
**Bench**: 3 players as backups.

### Budget and Player Values

Start the season with **550 cap**. Player values change week to week based on performance. You only realise profit or loss when you make a transfer. Bench players change in value too, so cheap backups can become trade gems.

Minimum player value is 10.

#### Player Value Formula

Values update gradually:

If the player played last week, average this week and last week’s points. Multiply by 10, subtract previous value, then add one-quarter of that to the previous value.

$$
\text{New Value} = V_{prev} + \frac{(P_{weighted} \times 10 - V_{prev})}{4}
$$

Where $V_{prev}$ is previous value and $P_{weighted}$ is the weighted points.

### Captain

Pick one **captain** from your starters each week. Captain points are doubled. A reliable captain beats a boom-or-bust star most weeks.

## Scoring

| Action    | Points |
| --------- | ------ |
| Goal      | +1     |
| Assist    | +2     |
| Block     | +3     |
| Drop      | -1     |
| Throwaway | -1     |

Total points are just the sum of starter stats, captain doubled.

### Automatic Subs

If a starter doesn’t play, the bench player in the same position automatically fills in.

## Weekly Management

1. Set your **starting 7**
2. Pick **captain**
3. Lock **bench**

Deadline hits, your team locks.

### Transfers

* **Week 1**: free swaps
* **After week 1**: max 2 swaps per week
* Must be same position. Budget rules apply. Profit/loss realised on transfers.

## Stay Informed
